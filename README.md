<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introducing SnipX

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

SnipX is a tool that gives you CSS and JavaScript injecting. It will watch over your files and the moment you make a change, it will inform your browser to reload (inject) the new CSS / JS. This all happens without reloading the page. Most importantly, it works in every browser we've been able to test on.

<!-- There are many great tools available on GitHub; however, We didn't find one that really suited our needs so we created this enhanced one.
We want to create a simple easy too use so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need  -->
-- We think this is it.

Here's why:

* The ability to change your webpage dynamically and remain persistent
* See and save changes in real time
* A workflow enhancement
* Put creativity in focus
* Inject newly-modified CSS and or JavaScript on every file change (without reloading the page) :smile:
<!-- * Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others -->
<!-- * A good improvement to the development workflow as you won't need to refresh and wait until the page is rendered again; you can see and save the changes in real time. -->

Of course, no one tool will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So we'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people that have contributed to expanding this!

### Making SnipX

Improving development workflows that can meet personal needs can help web developers to be more efficient and deliver a higher quality final product.
